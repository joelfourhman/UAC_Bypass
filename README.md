# Windows 10 UAC Bypass

# As It Stands
Proof-of-Concept exploit of a recently patched UAC bypass.
Super simple, and about half an hour of work.

This POC leverages the fodhelper technique from TrickBot.

## Vision
Ultimately, I'd like this project to turn into a one stop shop for known UAC bypass techniques. I will be researching future techniques and incorporating them into this project.

## Current Workflow
- Leverage the exploit
- Launch PowerShell 
- Clean up and return

## Future Workflow
- Detect Windows 10 build
- Select appropriate UAC bypass (if any exist)
- Leverage the exploit
- Launch PowerShell 
- Clean up and return
